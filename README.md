Logistic Regression and Transformer Models for Diagnosing PTSD from EEG data (94% accuracy on Transformer)

Data comes from [this dataset](https://osf.io/8bsvr/) by Su Mi Park.

As described in [this paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.707581/full), EEG data was collected from 945 patients. 850 of the patients were diagnosed with a mental disorder, and the other 95 patients were healthy controls. EEG data was collected by attaching 19-64 electrodes to patients, and recording of 5 minutes worth of EEG activity in resting state.

Patients were classified into 6 "general disorder" categories, including: Schizophrenia, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, addictive disorders, and trauma and stress-related disorders. They were also classified into 9 "specific disorder" categories: Schizophrenia, Depressive Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Alcohol Use Disorder, Behavioral Addiction Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Acute Stress Disorder, and Adjustment Disorder.
